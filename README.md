## Breast Cancer Model Comparison

This project evaluates multiple machine learning classifiers on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to identify the best-performing model based on accuracy and key performance metrics.

### Dataset
- Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset 

### Models Evaluated
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  

### Performance Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

### Conclusion
- The best-performing models based on accuracy and F1-score were **Decision Tree** and **Logistic Regression**, both achieving an accuracy of **0.893212**. However, the **F1-score is slightly better in
the case of the Decision Tree.**
- Further tuning of hyperparameters and feature engineering could enhance performance.
- A combination of models (e.g., ensemble methods) might improve classification results.
This study provides a foundational approach to breast cancer classification using machine learning.
Future work could involve deep learning techniques and larger datasets for improved accuracy.
